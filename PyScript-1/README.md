# Pig Game
A simple game which requies two players. Each player gets to roll a dice and the number except one gets added to their score and gets a second chance, if one turns out then he loses all the score that he/she has got upto now starting from his/her turn and other player gets the turn.
Very Poor Explaination, right?ðŸ˜…. Get the rules from this : [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_(dice_game)).

The player wins when he/she gets to 51 score.
Finally, when you get one winner, hit ALT+F4 to exit the game.
