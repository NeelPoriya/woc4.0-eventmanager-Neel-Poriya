# Event Manager Project
Winter of Code 4.0 Project

# Main Files and Directories
Here is a short description of what each directory is doing:
  1. Event_Manager : This is the main project file. Every URL request passes through this, and gets transferred to specified App. 
  2. registration : This is a Django app, which is the centre of this project.
  3. venv : This is a virtual enviornment, like a sandbox, it provides all necessary tools for running our app. So, if anyone has to try this app, he/she can activate the virutal environment and then start using it, without having to worrying about installing django and python.
  4. .dist : some settings for my VSCode editor. (probably none, but VSCode adds it anywayðŸ˜…)
  5. static : A directory for storing all the static files like javascript, css, images.
  6. db.sqlite3 : This is the database where our events and participant detatils will be stored.
  7. manage.py : This file does the management with its built-in features, like creating apps, starting the server, etc.
